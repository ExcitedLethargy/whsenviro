            Welcome to the Whakatane High School Enviro Club's website for energy audits! <br>
            <br>
            This site was developed to assist the Enviro Club with their energy audits. Every year,
            huge spreadsheets are used to record each audit, requiring countless hours of work
            from a number of people. This site intends to rationalise that process by making
            everything electronic and automatic, so that far less people need to be 'data monkeys'
            to allow the audits to take place. <br>
            <br>
            To find the other pages in the site, click on the left-hand side of this page to 
            open the menu - click anywhere else to exit it. Alternatively, click
            <a class="boldTextLink" onclick="toggleSidenav()">here</a>.<br>
            <br>
            For WHS Enviro Club members,
            <a class="boldTextLink" onclick="activateLogin()">sign in here</a>,
            or alternatively do so with the
            <a class="boldTextLink" onclick="toggleSidenav()">menu</a>.
